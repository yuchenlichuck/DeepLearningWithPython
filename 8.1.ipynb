    "Let's put these ideas in practice in a Keras implementation. The first thing we need is a lot of text data that we can use to learn a language model. You could use any sufficiently large text file or set of text files -- Wikipedia, the Lord of the Rings, etc. In this example we will use some of the writings of Nietzsche, the late-19th century German philosopher (translated to English). The language model we will learn will thus be specifically a model of Nietzsche's writing style and topics of choice, rather than a more generic model of the English language.\n"
